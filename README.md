# Chapter-13

In this chapter, I learned how to save and retrieve data locally in a Flutter app, ensuring persistence even after the app is closed. I explored how to structure data using the JSON format and create model classes to handle JSON serialization efficiently.

I discovered how to access local file storage on iOS and Android using the path provider package, making it easier to read and write data. I also learned how to format dates using the internationalization package and use the Future class with showDatePicker to let users select dates from a calendar.

Additionally, I explored how to save, read, and parse JSON files asynchronously with the Future class, and how to use ListView.separated to organize records with dividers. Sorting journal entries by date was made easy with List().sort.

To enhance user experience, I learned how to customize keyboard actions using textInputAction, and how to manage focus movement between input fields with FocusNode and FocusScope. Finally, I explored how to pass and receive data between screens using Navigator, making navigation seamless in Flutter apps.

This chapter gave me essential skills to handle local data storage effectively, improving both functionality and user experience in my applications.
